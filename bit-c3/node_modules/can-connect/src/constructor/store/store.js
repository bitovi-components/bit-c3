 * Supports saving and retrieving lists and instances in a store.
 * 
 * @signature `constructorStore(baseConnection)`
 * 
 *   Overwrites baseConnection so it contains a store for 
 *   instances and lists.  It traps calls to the
 *   [can.connect/constructor-store.hydrateInstance] and
 *   [can.connect/constructor-store.hydrateList] methods to
 *   use instances or lists in the store if available. It 
 *   overwrites "CRUD METHODS" to make sure that while any request
 *   is pending, all lists and instances are added to the store.
 *   Finally, it provides methods to add and remove items in the
 *   store via reference counting.
 * 
 * @body
 * 
 * ## Use
 * 
 * The `constructor-store` extension is used to:
 *  - provide a store of instances and lists used by the client.
 *  - prevent multiple instances from being hydrated for the same [connect.base.id] or multiple
 *    lists for the same [connect.base.listSet].
 * 
 * The stores provide access to an instance
 * by its [connect.base.id] or a list by its [connect.base.listSet]. These stores are
 * used by other extensions like [can-connect/real-time] and [can-connect/fall-through-cache].
 * 
 * Lets see how `constructor-store`'s behavior be used to prevent multiple 
 * instances from being hydrated.  This example allows you to create multiple instances of a `todoEditor` that loads
 * and edits a todo instance.
 * 
 * @demo can-connect/src/constructor/store/store.html
 * 
 * You'll notice that you can edit one todo's name and the other
 * todo editors update.  This is because each `todoEditor` gets the same instance in memory.  So that when it
 * updates the todo's name ...
 * 
 * ```
 * element.firstChild.onchange = function(){
 *   todo.name = this.value;
 * };
 * ```
 * 
 * ... the other widgets update because they have bound on the same instance:
 * 
 * ```
 * Object.observe(todo, update, ["update"] );
 * todosConnection.addInstanceReference(todo);
 * ```
 * 
 * Each `todoEditor` gets the same instance because they called [can.connect/constructor-store.addListReference]
 * which makes it so anytime a todo with `id=5` is requested, the same instance is returned.
 * 
 * Notice that if you change an input element, and click "Create Todo Editor", all the `todoEditor`
 * widgets are set back to the old text.  This is because whenever data is loaded from the server,
 * it is passed to [can-connect/constructor.updatedInstance] which defaults to overwriting any current 
 * properties with those from the server.
 * 
 * To make sure the server has the latest, you can save a todo by hitting "ENTER".
 * 
 * Finally, this widget cleans itself up nicely when it is removed by unobserving the
 * `todo` instance and 
 * [can.connect/constructor-store.deleteInstanceReference deleting the instance reference]. Doing this
 * prevents memory leaks.
 * 
 * ``` 
 * Object.unobserve(todo, update, ["update"] );
 * todosConnection.deleteInstanceReference(todo);
 * ```
 *

		 * ```
		 * // A basic connection:

		 *   originalTodo = todo;
		 * });
		 * ```
		 * 
		 * Now, if you were to retrieve the same data sometime later, 
		 * it would be the same instance.
		 * 
		 * ```
		 * todoConnection.get({id: 5}).then(function( todo ){
		 * 	
		 *   todo === originalTodo //-> true
		 * });
		 * ```
		 * 
		 * The `.getData`  response data is passed with `originalTodo` to [can-connect/constructor.updatedInstance]
		 * which can update the `originalTodo` with the new data.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * All these instances stay in memory.  Use [can.connect/constructor-store.deleteInstanceReference]
		 * to remove them.  
		 * 
		 * Typically, `addInstanceReference` is called when something expresses interest in the interest, such
		 * as an event binding, and `deleteInstanceReference` is called when interest is removed.
