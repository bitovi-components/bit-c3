# can-connect

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/canjs/can-connect.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/canjs/can-connect)

`can-connect` provides persisted data middleware. Use it to assemble powerful model layers for 
any JavaScript framework, not just CanJS.  [Play with it in a JSBin here.](http://jsbin.com/nazewa/edit?html,js)

It currently can:

Load data:

 - [can-connect/data-url] - Persist data to restful or other types of services.
 - [can-connect/data-parse] - Extract response data into a format needed for other extensions.

Convert data into special types:

 - [can-connect/constructor] - Create instances of a constructor function or list type.
 - [can-connect/constructor/store] - Create only a single instance for a given id or a single list for a set.

Real time:

 - [can-connect/real-time] - Update lists and instances with server side events.
 
Caching strategies:

 - [can-connect/fall-through-cache] - Respond with data from the [connection.cacheConnection] and 
   then update the response with data from the `raw CRUD Methods`.
 - [can-connect/data/inline-cache] - Use an inline cache for initial ajax requests.
 - [can-connect/cache-requests] - Save response data and use it for future requests.
 - [can-connect/data/combine-requests] - Combine overlapping or reduntant requests.

Caching layers:

 - [can-connect/data/localstorage-cache] - LocalStorage caching connection.
 - [can-connect/data/memory-cache] - LocalStorage caching connection.

The following modules glue certain methods together:

 - [can-connect/data/callbacks] - Glues the result of the `raw CRUD Methods` to callbacks.
 - [can-connect/data/callbacks-cache] - Calls [connection.cacheConnection] methods whenever `raw CRUD methods` are called. 


The following modules are useful to CanJS specifically:

 - [can-connect/can/map] - Create instances of a special can.Map or can.List type. 
 - [can-connect/can/super-map] - Create a connection for a can.Map or can.List that uses almost all the plugins.
 - [can-connect/can/model] - Inherit from a highly compatable [can.Model](http://canjs.com/docs/can.Model.html) implementation.
 - [can-connect/can/tag] - Create a custom element that can load data into a template.

## Overview

The "can-connect" module exports a `connect` function that is used to assemble different 
behaviors and some options into a `connection`.  For example, the following uses `connect` and
the [can-connect/constructor] and [can-connect/data-url] behaviors to create a `todoConnection`
connection:

```js
import connect from "can-connect";
import "can-connect/constructor/";
import "can-connect/data/url/";

var todoConnection = connect(
  ["constructor","data-url"],
  {
    url: "/services/todos"
  });
```

A connection typically provides the ability to 
create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) some data source. That data source is 
usually accessed through the "Instance Interface" methods:

 - [connection.get]
 - [connection.getList]
 - [connection.save]
 - [connection.destroy]

For example, to get all todos from "GET /services/todos", we could write the following:

```
todoConnection.getList({}).then(function(todos){ ... });
```

__Behaviors__, like [can-connect/constructor] and [can-connect/data-url] implement,
extend, or require some set of [interfaces](#section_Interfaces).  For example, data-url implements
the "Data Interface" methods, and [can-connect/constructor] implements the 
"Instance Interface" methods.

The `connect` method calls these behaviors in the right order to create a connection. For instance,
the [can-connect/cache-requests] behavior must be applied after the [can-connect/data-url]
connection.  This is because [can-connect/cache-requests], overwrites [can-connect/data-url]'s 
[connection.getListData] first check a cache for the data.  Only if the data is not present, 
does it call [can-connect/data-url]'s [connection.getListData]. So even if we write:

```
connect(['cache-requests','data-url'])
```

or

```
connect(['data-url','cache-requests'])
```
 
... our connection will be built in the right order!

A __connection__ is just an object with each behavior object on its prototype chain and
its options object at the end of the prototype chain.


## Use

This section covers how to install can-connect and then the basics of its use.

### Install

Use npm to install `can-connect`:

```
> npm install can-connect --save
```

Then, depending on your module loader, you'll do one of the following:

#### StealJS

Import can-connect and its behaviors like:

```
import connect from "can-connect";
import "can-connect/data/url/"
```

#### Browserify

`require` can-connect and its behaviors like:

```
var connect = require("can-connect");
import("can-connect/data/url/url");
```

#### AMD

Configure a package to can-connect and its dependency can-set:

```
require.config({
  packages: [{
    name: 'can-connect',
    location: 'node_modules/can-connect/dist/amd',
    main: 'can-connect'
  },{
    name: 'can-set',
    location: 'node_modules/can-connect/node_modules/can-set/dist/amd',
    main: 'src/set'
  }]
});
```

Then use `define` to load can-connect and its behaviors like:

```
define(["can-connect","can-connect/data/url/url"], function(connect){

});
```




### Basic connection

To use `can-connect`, it's typically best to start out with the most basic
behaviors: [can-connect/data-url] and [can-connect/constructor]. [can-connect/data-url]
connects the "Data Interface" to a restful service. [can-connect/constructor] adds
an "Instance Interface" that can create, read, update and delete (CRUD) typed data
using the lower-level "Data Interface".

By `typed` data we mean data that is more than just plain JavaScript objects.  For
example, we might to create `todo` objects with an `isComplete` method:

```
var Todo = function(props){
  Object.assign(this, props);
};

Todo.prototype.isComplete = function(){
  return this.status === "complete";
};
```

And, we might want a special list type with `completed` and `active` methods:

```
var TodoList = function(todos){
  [].push.apply(this, todos);
};
TodoList.prototype = Object.create(Array.prototype);

TodoList.prototype.completed = function(){
  return this.filter(function(todo){
    return todo.status === "complete";
  });
};

TodoList.prototype.active = function(){
  return this.filter(function(todo){
    return todo.status !== "complete";
  });
};
```

We can create a connection that connects a restful "/api/todos"
service to `Todo` instances and `TodoList` lists like:

```
var todoConnection = connect(["constructor","data-url"],{
  url: "/api/todos",
  list: function(listData, set){
  	return new TodoList(listData.data);
  },
  instance: function(props) {
  	return new Todo(props);
  }
});
```

And then use that connection to get a `TodoList` of `Todo`s:

```
todoConnection.getList({}).then(function(todos){
	var todosEl = document.getElementById("todos-list");
	todosEl.innerHTML = "<h2>Active</h2>"+
		render(todos.active())+
		"<h2>Complete</h2>"+
		render(todos.completed());
});

var render = function(todos) {
	return "<ul>"+todos.map(function(todo){
		return "<li>"+todo.name+
				"<input type='checkbox' "+
				(todo.isComplete() ? "checked" : "")+"/></li>";
	}).join("")+"</ul>";
};
```

The following demo shows the result:

@demo can-connect/docs/demos/basics.html

This connection also lets you create, update, and destroy a Todo instance as follows:

```
var todo = new Todo({
  name: "take out trash"
})

// POSTs to /api/todos name=take out trash
// server returns {id: 5}
todoConnection.save( todo ).then(function(todo){
  todo.id //-> 5
  todo.name = 'take out garbage'
  
  // PUTs to /api/todos/5 name=take out garbage
  // server returns {id: 5, "take out garbage"}
  todoConnection.save( todo ).then( function(todo){
    
    // DELETEs to /api/todos/5
    // server returns {}
    todoConnection.destroy( todo ).then( function(todo){
    
    });
    
  });
  
});
```

### Configure behaviors

Whenever `connect` creates a connection, it always adds the [connect.base] 
behavior. This behavior defines configurable options that are used by almost 
every other behavior.  For example, if your data uses an `_id` property 
to uniquely identify todos, you 
can specify this with [connect.base.idProp] like:

```
var todoConnection = connect(["constructor","data-url"],{
  url: "/api/todos",
  idProp: "_id"
});
```

Other behaviors list their configurable options in their own docs page.  

### Overwrite behaviors

If configurable options are not enough, you can overwrite any behavior with your own behavior.

For example, the `constructor`'s [can-connect/constructor.updatedInstance] behavior 
sets the instance's properties to match the result of [connection.updateData]. But if
the `PUT /api/todos/5 name=take out garbage` request returned `{}`, the following would result in 
a todo with only an `id` property:

```
var todo = new Todo({id: 5, name: "take out garbage"})
// PUTs to /api/todos/5 name=take out garbage
// server returns {}
todoConnection.save( todo ).then( function(todo){
     
  todo.id //-> 5
  todo.name //-> undefined
});
```

The following overwrites the behavior of `updateData`:

```
var mergeDataBehavior = {
  updateData: function(instance, data){
    Object.assign(instance, data);
  }
}


var todoConnection = connect([
    "constructor",
    "data-url", 
    mergeDataBehavior
  ],{
  url: "/api/todos"
});
```

You can add your own behavior that overwrite all base behaviors by adding
it to the end of the behaviors list.


### CanJS use

If you are using CanJS, you can either:

- use the [can-connect/can/map] behavior that overwrites
  many methods and settings to work with `can.Map` and `can.List`.
- use the [can-connect/can/super-map] helper to create a connection that bundles "can/map" and 
  many of the other extensions.

Using [can-connect/can/map] to create a connection looks like:

```
var Todo = can.Map.extend({ ... });
Todo.List = can.List.extend({Map: Todo},{});

var todoConnection = connect([
    "data-url",
    "can/map",
    "constructor",
    "constructor-store"
  ],{
  Map: Todo,
  url: "/todos"
});
```

When you bind on a `Todo` instance or `Todo.List` list, they will automatically call
[can.connect/constructor-store.addInstanceReference] and [can.connect/constructor-store.addListReference].

Using [can-connect/can/super-map] to create a connection looks like:

```
var Todo = can.Map.extend({ ... });
Todo.List = can.List.extend({Map: Todo},{});

var todoConnection = superMap({
  Map: Todo,
  url: "/todos"
});
```

### Other use

Integrating `can-connect` with your framework is typically pretty easy.  In general,
the pattern involves creating a behavior that integrates with your framework's
observable instances. The [can-connect/can/map]
behavior can serve as a good guide. You'll typically want to implement the following
in your behavior:

`.instance` - Creates the appropriate observable object type.  
`.list` - Creates the appropriate observable array type.  
`.serializeInstance` - Return a plain object out of the observable object type.  
`.serializeList` - Return a plain array out of the observable array type.  

`.createdInstance` - Update an instance with data returned from `createData`.  
`.updatedInstance` - Update an instance with data returned from `updateData`.  
`.destroyedInstance` -  Update an instance with data returned from `destroyData`.  
`.updatedList` - Update a list with raw data.

And, in most frameworks you know when a particular observable is being used, typically
observed, and when it can be discarded.  In those places, you should call:

[can.connect/constructor-store.addInstanceReference] - Call when an instance is being used.  
[can.connect/constructor-store.deleteInstanceReference] - Call when an instance is no longer being used.  
[can.connect/constructor-store.addListReference] - Call when a list is being used.  
[can.connect/constructor-store.deleteListReference] - Called when a list is no longer being used.  


## Interfaces

## Creating Behaviors

To create your own behavior, call `connect.behavior` with the name of your behavior and a function that
returns an object that defines the hooks you want to overwrite or provide:

```js
connect.behavior("my-behavior", function(baseBehavior){
  return {
    // Hooks here
  };
})
```

For example, creating a simple localStorage behavior might look like:

```js
connect.behavior("localstorage", function(baseBehavior){
  return {
    getData: function(params){
      var id = this.id(params);
      return new Promise(function(resolve){
        var data = localStorage.getItem(baseBehavior.name+"/"+id);
        resolve( JSON.parse(data) )
      });
    },
    createData: function(props){
      var id = localStorage.getItem(baseBehavior.name+"-ID") || "0";
      
      var nextId = ++JSON.parse( id );
      localStorage.setItem(baseBehavior.name+"-ID"), nextId);
      var id = this.idProp;
      return new Promise(function(resolve){
        props[id] = nextId;
        localStorage.setItem(baseBehavior.name+"/"+nextId, props);
        resolve( props )
      });
    },
    updateData: function(){ ... },
    destroyData: function(){ ...}
  };
})
```
