# can-set

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/canjs/can-set.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/canjs/can-set)

__can-set__ is a utility for comparing [sets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#Basic_concepts_and_notation) that 
are represented by the parameters commonly passed to service requests. 

For example, the set `{type: "critical"}` might represent all 
critical todos.  It is a superset of the set `{type: "critical", due: "today"}` 
which might represent all critical todos due today.

__can-set__ is useful for building caching and other data-layer
optimizations.  It can be used in client or server
environments. [can-connect](http://connect.canjs.com) uses can-set to create data modeling
utilities and middleware for the client.

## Install

Use npm to install `can-set`:

> npm install can-set --save

## Use

Use `require` in Node/Browserify workflows to import `can-set` like:

```
var set = require('can-set');
```

Use `define`, `require` or `import` in [StealJS](http://stealjs.com)  workflows to import `can-set` like:

```
import set from 'can-set'
```

Once you've imported `set` into your project, use it to compare sets.  The following example
defines a `getTodos` function that gets todo data from a memory cache or from the server.

```js
var cache = [];

var getTodos = function(params, cb) {
  
  // check cache
  for(var i = 0 ; i < cache.length; i++) {
    var cacheEntry = cache[i];
    if(set.subset( cacheEntry.params, params ) ) {
      var matchingTodos = cacheEntry.items.filter(function(item){
        return set.subset(item, params);
      })
      return cb(matchingTodos);
    }
  }
  
  // not in cache, get and save in cache
  $.get("/todos",params, function(todos){
    cache.push({
      params: params,
      items: todos
    });
    cb(todos);
  });
}
```


## API

In __can-set__ a set is a plain JavaScript object 
like `{start: 0, end: 100, filter: "top"}`.  Often, these are the 
parameters you pass to the server to retrieve some list of data.

Unlike [set mathmatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)), these
set objects don't contain the items of the set, instead they represent the items within the set.

### Special Sets

Unlike in common [set mathmatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) the set `{}` represents the 
superset of all sets.  For instance if you load all items represented by set `{}`, you have loaded 
every item in that "universe".

## set.equal

`set.equal(a, b, algebra) -> Boolean`

Returns true if the two sets the exact same.

```js
set.equal({type: "critical"}, {type: "critical"}) //-> true
```

## set.subset

Returns true if _A_ is a subset of _B_ or _A_ is equal to _B_ (_A_ ⊆ _B_).

`set.subset(a, b, algebra) -> Boolean`

```js
set.subset({type: "critical"}, {}) //-> true
set.subset({}, {}) //-> true
```

## set.properSubset

Returns true if _A_ is a strict subset of _B_ (_A_ ⊂ _B_).

`set.properSubset(a, b, algebra)`


```js
set.properSubset({type: "critical"}, {}) //-> true
set.properSubset({}, {}) //-> false
```

## set.intersection

`set.intersection(a, b, algebra) -> set`

Returns a set that represents the intersection of sets _A_ and _B_ (_A_ ∩ _B_).

```js
set.intersection( 
  {completed: true, due: "tomorrow"}, 
  {completed: true, type: "critical"},
  {...} ) //-> {completed: true, due: "tomorrow", type: "critical"}
```


## set.difference

`set.difference(a, b, algebra) -> set|true|false`

Returns a set that represents the difference of sets _A_ and _B_ (_A_ \ _B_), or
returns if a difference exists.

If `true` is returned, that means that _B_ is a subset of _A_, but no set object
can be returned that represents that set.

If `false` is returned, that means there is no difference or the sets are not comparable.

```js
// A has all of B
set.difference( {} , {completed: true}, set.boolean("completed") ) //-> {completed: false}

// A has all of B, but we can't figure out how to create a set object
set.difference( {} , {completed: true} ) //-> true

// A is totally inside B
set.difference( {completed: true}, {} )  //-> false
```

## set.union

`set.union(a, b, algebra) -> set | undefined`

Returns a set that represents the union of _A_ and _B_ (_A_ ∪ _B_).

```js
set.union( 
  {start: 0, end: 99}, 
  {start: 100, end: 199},
  {...} ) //-> {start: 0, end: 199}
```


## set.count

`set.count(a, algebra) -> Number`

Returns the number of items that might be loaded by set _A_. This makes use of set.Algebra's
By default, this returns Infinity.


## set.Algebra

`new set.Algebra(compares...)`

Creates an object that can perform binary operations on sets with an awareness of
how certain properties represent the set.

### compares `Object<String: comparator>`

An object of property names and `comparator` functions.

```js
{
  // return `true` if the values should be considered the same:
  lastName: function(aValue, bValue){
    return (""+aValue).toLowerCase() === (""+bValue).toLowerCase();
  }
}
```

### comparator(aValue, bValue, a, b, prop, algebra)

A comparator function returns algebra values for two values for a given property.


#### params

- `aValue` - the value of A's property in a set difference A and B (A \ B).
- `bValue` - the value of A's property in a set difference A and B (A \ B).
- `a` - the A set in a set difference A and B (A \ B).
- `a` - the B set in a set difference A and B (A \ B).

#### returns

A comparator function should either return a Boolean which indicates if `aValue` and `bValue` are
equal or an `AlgebraResult` object that details information about the union, intersection, and
difference of `aValue` and `bValue`.

An `AlgebraResult` object has the following values:

- [union] - A value the represents the union of A and B.
- [intersection] - A value that represents the intersection of A and B.
- [difference] - A value that represents all items in A that are not in B. 
- [count] - The count of the items in A.

For example, if you had a `colors` property and A is `["Red","Blue"]` and B is `["Green","Yellow","Blue"]`, the 
AlgebraResult object might look like:

```js
{
  union: ["Red","Blue","Green","Yellow"],
  intersection: ["Blue"],
  difference: ["Red"],
  count: 2000
}
```

The count is `2000` because there might be 2000 items represented by colors "Red" and "Blue".  Often 
the real number can not be known.

## set.comparators

The following functions create `compares` objects that can be mixed together to create a set `Algebra`. 

For example, the following uses jQuery's extend to mixin two comparator behaviors into a compares object:

```js
var compares = $.extend(
  {
    // ignore this property in set algebra
    sessionId:  function(){ return true }
  }, 
  set.comparators.boolean("completed"),
  set.comparators.range("start","end") );
  
var algebra = new set.Algebra( compares )
```

### set.comparators.boolean

`set.comparators.boolean(property) -> compare`

Makes a compare object with a `property` function that has the following logic:

```
A(true) ∪ B(false) = undefined

A(undefined) \ B(true) = false
A(undefined) \ B(false) = true
```

It understands that `true` and `false` are complementary sets that
combined to `undefined`.  Another way to think of this is that if you
load `{complete: false}` and `{complete: true}` you've loaded `{}`.

### set.comparators.rangeInclusive

`set.comparators.rangeInclusive(startIndexProperty, endIndexProperty) -> compare`

Makes a comparator for two ranged properties that specify a range of items
that includes both the startIndex and endIndex.  For example, a range of
[0,20] loads 21 items.

### set.comparators.enum

`set.comparators.enum(property, propertyValues) -> compare`

Makes a comparator for a set of values.

```
var compare = set.comparators.enum("type", ["new","accepted","pending","resolved"])
```


## set.getSubset

`set.get.subset(a, b, bItems, algebra) //-> aItems`

Gets A set's items given a super set B and its items.


## set.getUnion

`set.getUnion(a, b, aItems, bItems, algebra) //-> unionItems`

Unifies items from set A and setB into a single array of items.
