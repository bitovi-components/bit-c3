Syn lets you simulate user behavior like typing, clicking, moving, and 
dragging exactly how a real user would perform those actions.

```js
Syn.click( 'hello' )
   .type( 'Hello World' )
   .drag( 'trash' ); 
```

## Install

Install Syn via the command line with npm:

    > npm install syn
    
or bower:

    > bower install syn

Or by downloading it [here](https://github.com/bitovi/syn/archive/master.zip).

Inside the download, npm package and bower package, there are the following folders:

 - `dist/syn.js` - A standalone file that can be used with a `<script>` tag.
 - `dist/amd` - An AMD build that can be used with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) and other AMD loaders.
 - `dist/cjs` - A CommonJS build that is used by node or browserify.
 - `src` - The source files that can be loaded by [StealJS](http://stealjs.com), SystemJS, and eventually JSPM.

## Setup

The following walk you through how to load Syn into various environments.

### Node / Browserify

Assuming you installed with `npm`, simply `require("syn")` like the following:

    var syn = require("syn");
    syn.click(document.getElementById('hello'));

### StealJS

If you installed via NPM or Bower and are using the [npm](http://stealjs.com/docs/npm.html) 
or [bower](http://stealjs.com/docs/bower.html) module for configuration,
you can use import, require, or define to load the syn module without any configuration.

    import syn from "syn";
    syn.click(document.getElementById('hello'));

### AMD / RequireJS

Add the following package configuration:

    require.config({
        packages: [{
            name: 'syn',
            location: 'PATH/TO/syn/dist/amd',
            main: 'syn'
        }]
    });

_PATH/TO_ should be the path from your baseUrl to the location of the syn folder.  Once this is 
properly configured, you should be able to write:

    define(['syn'], function(syn){
      syn.click(document.getElementById('hello'));
    });

### Script Tag / Standalone

If you don't use a module loader, you can simply add the following to your page:

   <script src='PATH/TO/dist/syn.js'></script>

_PATH/TO_ should be the path to the installed syn folder.

## Use




### syn.click( element [, options][, callback] )

### syn.dblclick( element [, options][, callback] )

### syn.type( element, text [, callback] )

### syn.key( element, key [, callback] )

### syn.delay( time=600 )
 
### syn.drag( element, optionsOrTarget [, callback])



## Contributing

To fix a bug, fork and clone `bitovi/syn` to your computer. Next, install its npm dependencies with:

    npm install
    
Please add a test within the _tests_ folder and make your changes to _syn.js_ source files in the _src_ 
folder. For a quick check that everything is working, open _test/test.html_.

To make sure all the distributables are working, run:

    npm test
  
## Code Organization

All source files are in the _src_ folder.  Here's what each files does:

 - _browsers.js_ - Contains the output of _utils/recorder.html_ data.
 - _drag.js_ - Drag / drop utility.
 - _key.js_ - Typing and key event simulation.
 - _key.support.js_ - Feature detection of key event behavior.
 - _mouse.js_ - Click and mouse event simulation.
 - _mouse.support.js_ - Feature detection of mouse event behavior.
 - _syn.js_ - Main entrypoint that loads all other modules.
 - _synthtic.js_ - Creates the `syn` object and adds helpers used by other modules.
 - _typeable.js_ - Used to test if an element can be typed into.

Tests are in the _test_ folder.

 _utils/recorder.html_ is used to record behaviors of the browser that can not be feature detected.  Those
behaviors are added to _src/browser.js_.
