# system-json

This is a plugin for [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) and 
[StealJS](http://stealjs.com/) that makes it easy to work with JSON.

## Use

By running `json.js`, it will add its behavior to a System loader. Once it has been added, it
will check if each file looks like JSON.  If it does, the JSON data will be returned as the module's value.
