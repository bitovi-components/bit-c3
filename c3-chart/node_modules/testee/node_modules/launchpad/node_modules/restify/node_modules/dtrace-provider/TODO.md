# dtrace-provider - TODO

## FEATURES

### Complex Arguments

Right now the argument types are just 'int' and 'char *'. There's no
possibility of passing, say, javascript objects through DTrace. 

It seems like there's two things that need to be done here: 

 * Find the right format for taking complex argument values through DTrace
 * Find a way to teach DTrace about what we're emitting

### Dynamic Updates

These providers are already pretty dynamic in that you get to create
them based on runtime data - but you only get to do that once, for
each provider. 

It'd be nice to be able to modify providers that already exist,
updating or adding to their probe definitions. This opens up the
possibility of providers which dynamically add probes based on data,
and given a high level of collusion between a JIT and the provider
management, much lower overhead dynamic-language tracing by having the
JIT output tracepoints directly.

## PERFORMANCE

### Disabled Probe Effect

The main problem here is how much work needs to be done to get to the
point we can use the is-enabled check.

While the is-enabled check allows us to avoid invoking the probe-args
callback with its potentially expensive args-gathering work, we still
do the following when a disabled probe is fired:

 * Dispatch Fire method from JS
 * Obtain DTraceProvider instance from V8 context
 * Args checking (must get a probe name and a callback)
 * Linear search through provider's probes for probe name
 * Invoke the is-enabled stub

The fix I'd like to make here is to allow probes to exist as JS
functions themselves, so that the calling code can directly invoke the
function to fire the probe, avoiding the search by name. In this
situation we could also defer checking the arguments until the probe
is actually fired.

With these changes, the disabled-probe overhead should be reduced to a
JS method call, and then the invocation of the is-enabled stub.

The API change to support this would be to return these probe
functions from provider.addProbe(), rather than calling through
provider.fire(), though that could easily remain for backwards
compatibility.
