Depending on what you're trying to do, you may or may not be on the right page:

* If you're a designer or only care about creating a Live Style Guide, you will probably prefer reading this at [DocumentCSS.com](http://documentcss.com/docs/index.html)
* If you're a developer or you're also interested in API documentation, you may want to use [DocumentJS.com](http://documentjs.com/docs/live-style-guide.html) so you have quick access to other information

[DocumentCSS.com](http://documentcss.com) was created as a simple reference for the Live Style Guide **feature** of DocumentJS. The *name of the tool you'll be downloading* is DocumentJS even if you're using it for style documentation.

While DocumentJS was originally built to create API documentation, it can also be used to generate a Live Style Guide. With the style documentation features of DocumentJS, you can:

* Document your project's styles inline in `.css`, `.less`, or `.scss` files
* Write documentation in markdown files
* Create a standalone style guide page (even if you're not using DocumentJS for JavaScript documentation)
* Include demos and examples
