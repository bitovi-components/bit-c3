The [Standalone Guide](/docs/lsg-quickstart.html) is likely more precise when it comes to step-by-step instructions. Unfortunately, since we don't know exactly how your project looks we'll be making a number of assumptions for this guide:

* Your project uses npm
* The API docs are configured in a `documentjs.json` file
* Other general assumptions about your project's setup and configuration

There are a few ways to compensate for the ways this guide may differ from your specific project setup:

* Go through this guide with a developer who understands how the API Documentation is set up in your project
* Ask questions on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/bitovi/documentcss)
* Open [an issue](https://github.com/bitovi/documentcss/issues/new) to let us know when something isn't clear
